<p>Download human fall flat free for android on M26 Gaming Store</p><br>
<h2>About Game</h2>
<p>
  The latest Worldwide Workshop competition winning level offers anything but a relaxed tee off. These fairways throw up more than just rough grass and sandtraps!
<br><br>
Watch out for giant clubs that propel your Human through the air and don't miss catching a ride on the windmill sail. The view is even better with seven friends online!<br><br>
Each dream level provides a new environment to navigate, from mansions, castles and Aztec adventures to snowy mountains, eerie nightscapes and industrial locations. Multiple routes through each level, and perfectly playful puzzles ensure exploration and ingenuity are rewarded.<br><br>
Of course, your Human's wobbly movements don't make things easy, and whether you're jumping, climbing, carrying or swinging, things can easily go very wrong - with very funny results.
<br><br>
Should your Human fall from a rope, misjudge a platform or even get pushed off a cliff by a friend, never fear: they will simply fall back into the dream, ready to try again and again.
<br><br>
Human: Fall Flat can be played solo or with up to 8 players online for even more laughter. What's more, regular free level releases mean there's no end to the fun in sight!<br><br>

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">NOTICE:</p><p style="font-size: 15px;">This game is already pre-installed for you, meaning you don’t have to install it.

You need these programs for the game to run. Look for a ‘HOW TO RUN GAME!!.txt’ file for more help. Also, be sure to right click the exe and always select “Run as administrator” if you’re having problems saving the game.
